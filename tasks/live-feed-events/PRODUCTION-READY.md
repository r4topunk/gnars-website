   - Fast initial load (~100ms cached)
   - Background refresh
   - Optimized for Vercel

3. **Filtering**
   - Category filter (7 types)
   - Priority filter (3 levels)
   - Time range (1h to all time)
   - Comments-only toggle

4. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive design
   - Dark mode
   - Infinite scroll
   - Loading states
   - Empty states
   - Error handling

5. **Event Types (12/18 = 67%)**
   - ✅ ProposalCreated
   - ✅ VoteCast (with comments)
   - ✅ ProposalQueued
   - ✅ ProposalExecuted
   - ✅ ProposalCanceled
   - ✅ ProposalVetoed
   - ✅ VotingOpened (computed)
   - ✅ VotingClosingSoon (computed)
   - ✅ AuctionCreated
   - ✅ AuctionBid
   - ✅ AuctionSettled
   - ✅ TokenMinted

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000/feed
# You should see REAL DATA from the blockchain!
```

### 2. Verify Real Data

Check that you see:
- Real proposal titles from Gnars DAO
- Real voter addresses (0x...)
- Real auction amounts in ETH
- Recent timestamps ("2m ago", etc.)

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement live feed with real blockchain data"
git push

# Vercel will auto-deploy
# Or manually:
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Verify in Vercel dashboard:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOLDSKY_PROJECT_ID=project_cm33ek8kjx6pz010i2c3w8z25
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Next.js 15 Caching**
   - `unstable_cache` is powerful
   - Automatic revalidation is seamless
   - Edge caching on Vercel is fast

2. **The Graph Integration**
   - Goldsky subgraph is reliable
   - GraphQL queries are flexible
   - Data is well-indexed

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Separation of concerns
   - Easy to extend
   - Type-safe throughout

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Data Transformation**
   - Subgraph data structure varies
   - Needed flexible transform functions
   - Type safety required careful mapping

2. **Cache Strategy**
   - Balancing freshness vs performance
   - 15s TTL is a good sweet spot
   - Background revalidation prevents stale data

3. **Event Coverage**
   - Some events need multiple queries
   - Computed events require timing logic
   - Not all contract events in subgraph

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Issue: No events showing**
- Check subgraph URL
- Verify network requests
- Check console for errors
- Try hard refresh

**Issue: Stale data**
- Check cache TTL (should be 15s)
- Check revalidate setting
- Force refresh with Cmd+Shift+R

**Issue: Too many requests**
- Increase cache TTL
- Increase polling interval
- Check for multiple tabs

### Monitoring

**What to Monitor:**
- Subgraph response times
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates
- Page load times

**Tools:**
- Vercel Analytics
- Next.js built-in metrics
- Custom logging
- User feedback
