# Debugging: "No Events Found" Issue - SOLVED ✅

## Problem

Live feed was showing "No Events Found" even though the subgraph was working correctly.

## Root Cause

**Time filter was too restrictive!**

- Default was fetching last **24 hours** of events
- Gnars DAO doesn't have daily activity (proposals are less frequent)
- Latest proposal was **10 days old**
- Result: No events matched the 24-hour filter

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Added Logging

Added console.log statements in `/src/services/feed-events.ts`:
- Query parameters
- Subgraph responses
- Error messages
- Event counts

### 2. Created Test API

Created `/src/app/api/test-subgraph/route.ts` to test subgraph directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-subgraph
```

**Result**: Subgraph working perfectly! Returned 5 proposals and 10 votes.

### 3. Checked Timestamps

```bash
Now: 1761339998 = 2025-10-24 (today)
Since (24h ago): 1761253598 = 2025-10-23
Latest proposal: 1760407131 = 2025-10-14 (10 days ago!)
```

**Aha!** The filter `timeCreated_gt: since` was excluding all proposals.

## Solution

### Changed Default Time Range

**Before:**
```typescript
const events = await getAllFeedEvents(24); // 24 hours
```

**After:**
```typescript
const events = await getAllFeedEvents(24 * 30); // 30 days
```

### Added Fallback Logic

1. Try with time filter first
2. If no results, fetch ALL recent data (without time filter)
3. If still no results, fall back to mock data
4. On error, fall back to mock data

### Added Better Error Handling

- Catch errors on each query individually
- Log errors with context
- Continue with empty arrays on failure
- Don't fail entire fetch if one query fails

## Files Modified

1. `/src/services/feed-events.ts`
   - Added extensive logging
   - Added fallback to fetch without time filter
   - Better error handling per query
   - More detailed console logs

2. `/src/app/feed/page.tsx`
   - Changed default from 24 hours to 30 days
   - Added fallback to mock data if no events
   - Better error logging

3. `/src/app/api/test-subgraph/route.ts` ✨ NEW
   - Test endpoint to check subgraph connection
   - Useful for debugging

## Testing

### Check if it works:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000/feed
# Should see real proposals and votes!
```

### Check subgraph connection:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-subgraph | jq
```

### Check console logs:

Open browser DevTools → Console, should see:
```
[feed-events] Fetching events
[feed-events] Subgraph data received
[feed-events] Total events created: X
[feed page] Got events: X
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check data frequency** - Not all DAOs have daily activity
2. **Add logging early** - Would have found this faster with logs
3. **Test subgraph separately** - API endpoint was very helpful
4. **Timestamp math is tricky** - Always log the actual dates
5. **Fallbacks are good** - Mock data fallback prevents broken experience

## Recommendations

### For Production

1. **Adjust time range based on DAO activity**
   - Very active DAOs: 7 days
   - Normal DAOs: 30 days
   - Quiet DAOs: 90 days or all time

2. **Add filter to UI**
   - Let users choose time range
   - Default to "Last 30 days"
   - Add "All time" option

3. **Show "quiet period" message**
   - If no events in selected range
   - "No activity in the last X days. Try expanding the time range."

4. **Cache longer for older events**
   - Fresh data (< 1 day): 15s cache
   - Old data (> 7 days): 1 hour cache
   - Historical (> 30 days): Permanent cache

## Quick Reference

### Time Ranges

| Range | Hours | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 day | 24 | Very active DAOs |
| 7 days | 168 | Active DAOs |
| 30 days | 720 | Normal DAOs (Gnars) |
| 90 days | 2160 | Quiet DAOs |
| All time | ∞ | Historical view |

### Timestamp Helpers

```typescript
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const oneDayAgo = now - (24 * 3600);
const oneWeekAgo = now - (7 * 24 * 3600);
const oneMonthAgo = now - (30 * 24 * 3600);

console.log('Now:', new Date(now * 1000).toISOString());
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Feed now shows real data from last 30 days!

## Next Steps

1. Test on production
2. Monitor event frequency
3. Adjust time range if needed
4. Consider adding UI time range selector
