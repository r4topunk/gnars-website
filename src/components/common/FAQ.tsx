    question: "What is a Gnar?",
    answer: "A Gnar is an on-chain membership NFT for the action-sports community. Each Gnar gives you a vote in Gnars DAO. Artwork is CC0 (public domain)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Gnars DAO?",
    answer: "A community-owned action-sports brand funding athletes and creators via on-chain auctions and a shared treasury—now on Base."
  },
  {
    question: "Where do auctions happen?",
    answer: "On Base. The DAO and treasury migrated to Base for cheaper, faster participation."
  },
  {
    question: "How do auctions work?",
    answer: "New Gnars are auctioned continuously on-chain. Anyone can bid; the winner mints the Gnar and funds flow to the DAO treasury to back proposals."
  },
  {
    question: "Who can own a Gnar, and what does it mean?",
    answer: "Anyone can win an auction or buy on secondary. Holding a Gnar equals one vote in Gnars DAO."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Gnars free to use?",
    answer: "Yes. CC0—use, remix, commercialize, no permission needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of projects does Gnars fund?",
    answer: "Athlete sponsorships, community infrastructure, creative media, and education/safety initiatives."
  },
  {
    question: "Who created Gnars?",
    answer: "Launched by Nounish builders and action-sports enthusiasts; stewarded by Gnars DAO via on-chain governance."
  },
  {
    question: "What happened to the old Ethereum (L1) Gnars?",
    answer: "L1 pieces remain as collectibles; governance and new drops are on Base."
  },
  {
    question: "Where do I get $GNARS?",
    answer: "On Zora under the @gnars profile."
  },
  {
    question: "What is $GNARS vs a Gnar?",
    answer: "$GNARS (Zora creator coin) is a liquid social token for the Gnars profile; a Gnar NFT gives DAO voting power. Different purposes—many hold both."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I propose something for funding?",
    answer: "Hold a Gnar and submit a proposal through governance; the DAO votes and, if approved, funds it."
